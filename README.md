# IDS576-Deep-Learning
This repository contains all assignments, the final project, and side projects from my Deep Learning course. It includes implementations of key deep learning concepts such as neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, transformers, and optimization techniques. Projects cover real-world applications in image processing, NLP, and more.

Topics Covered:

* Neural Networks & Backpropagation
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & LSTMs
* Transformers & Attention Mechanisms
* Transfer Learning & Fine-tuning
* Optimization & Hyperparameter Tuning
